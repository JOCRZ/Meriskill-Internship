    "- Order ID: This column represents a unique identifier for each order. It can be used to track individual orders and analyze order-related metrics such as order frequency, order size, or customer loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product: This column contains information about the products sold. It can be used to analyze product-specific metrics such as sales by product, product popularity, or product performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantity Ordered: This column indicates the quantity of each product ordered in a particular transaction. It can be used to analyze sales volume, identify popular products, or calculate average order size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Price Each: This column represents the price of each product in a transaction. It can be used to calculate total sales, average order value, or analyze pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Order Date: This column captures the date and time of each order. It can be used to analyze sales trends over time, identify seasonality patterns, or track performance by specific time periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly).\n",
    " \n",
    "- Purchase Address: This column contains the address where each order was placed. It can be used to analyze sales by location, identify high-performing regions, or understand customer demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Month: This column represents the month in which each order was placed. It can be used to analyze monthly sales trends, compare performance across different months, or identify seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sales: This column represents the total sales amount for each order. It is calculated by multiplying the Quantity Ordered by the Price Each. It can be used as a primary KPI to analyze overall sales performance, track revenue growth, or compare sales across different products or regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- City: This column captures the city where each order was placed. It can be used to analyze sales by city, identify top-performing cities, or target specific geographical areas for marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hour: This column indicates the hour of the day when each order was placed. It can be used to analyze sales patterns throughout the day, identify peak hours, or optimize staffing and inventory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these columns, some potential KPIs to consider for analysis could include total sales, average order value, sales by product category, sales by city or region, sales trends over time, customer segmentation based on purchase behavior, or conversion rates."

    "- Sales by Time Period: Analyzing sales trends over different time periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly) helps identify seasonality patterns, understand sales fluctuations, and make informed decisions about resource allocation and inventory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top-Selling Products: Identifying the best-selling products in terms of quantity sold or revenue generated can help focus marketing efforts, optimize inventory levels, and identify opportunities for cross-selling or upselling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Profit Margins: Calculating profit margins by product or product category provides insights into the profitability of different items. This information can guide pricing strategies, cost management, and product portfolio decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer Acquisition and Retention: Tracking the number of new customers acquired and the rate of customer retention helps evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, customer loyalty programs, and customer satisfaction initiatives.\n",
